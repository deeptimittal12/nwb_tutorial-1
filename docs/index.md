Welcome to the official NWB tutorial! The interactive tutorial is a Jupyter notebook that explains the structure of NWB and takes one through the process of reading and writing an NWB file. It is currently under development and will be published when all founding NWB datasets are officially released. In the meantime, you may view a nearly-complete static version of the tutorial [here](assets/tutorial.pdf) and the official NWB documentation [here](assets/nwbdoc.html). The static version will get you up to speed with the scope and structure of NWB. Please check back in a few weeks for the full-featured dynamic version.
